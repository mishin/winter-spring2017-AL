## Heroku Depoly Instructions
The project is setup to allow both automatic and manual deployment of the project via Heroku.  
To automatically deploy:  
1. Make a change to the project's code.
2. Push the change to the master branch of the project.
3. Heroku will perform an automatic deployment of the main branch.
  
To manually deploy:  
1. Access the Heroku app for SLO Chart.
2. Select the Deployment tab in the Heroku app.
3. In the Manual deploy section, select a branch for Heroku to deploy.
4. Select "Deploy Branch".
5. Heroku will perform a deployment of the selected branch.

## Administrate the Project  

To become an administrator for the project, you will need a Github and Heroku account. Afterwards, contact one of the owners of the project. These are the Github usernames of the owners: leklein, alexbcastana, vivian46959, cevenhub, and brady-aiello.  
If the owner approves, then you will receive two separate emails, one for accessing the project on Github and one for accessing the Heroku app. Accept the requests and you will be able to begin administraing for SLO Chart.

## Conclusion  
There are a few things that we have accomplished well in this project. 
1. The flowchart design for the user and administrator closely resembles that of the flowchart design used by Cal Poly. This makes it simpler for users from Cal Poly to recognize the structure of the flowchart and how it can be used.  
2. The administrator is capable of editing the course catalog and default flowcharts through the application. This reduces the need for an administrator to understand how to make changes to the database and she can instead focus on the main task.  

Overall, we consider the project a success.

## Key Learnings
1. Understand the technologies decided upon by the team.
2. Figure out an effective communication channel for the team early on.
3. Software architecture patterns allow for quick understanding and identification of code, along with being a proven solution to common problems faced.
